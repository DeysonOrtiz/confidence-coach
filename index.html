                    <p>
                        With over 30 years of experience in the video industry
                        as a video editor, director, and producer, I bring deep
                        technical expertise to every coaching session. My 12
                        years as a dancer and entertainer taught me the power of
                        stage presence and authentic performance.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This unique combination of technical mastery and
                        performance experience allows me to help you build both
                        the technical setup and genuine confidence you need to
                        succeed.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Growing up with a father who believed that confidence
                        was essential for success, and that a person who is not
                        shy will never go hungry, shaped my understanding of how
                        confidence transforms lives and businesses.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        My students have discovered that their unique voice (the
                        very thing they thought might hold them back) became
                        their most powerful business asset. When you work with
                        me, you are not learning to be like someone else. You
                        are learning to be powerfully, authentically,
                        irresistibly you.
